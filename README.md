# Stock-Price-Prediction-by-Machine-Learning
This project predicts stock price movement using SVM, Naive Bayesian, Boosting and Locally-weight regression. Notice that stock price is extremely hard to predict, this project 
actually predicts the stock price on the financial report release day.
## Data
There 2 types of data:
1. Financial report. Companies release their financial report every quarter, which is meaningful to stock price.
2. Analytical articles. Many editorials will write analytical articles with respect to the financial report, which is also meaningful.

## How to use
