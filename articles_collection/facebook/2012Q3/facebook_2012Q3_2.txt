Facebook was expected to post third quarter adjusted earnings of 11 cents per share on revenue of $1.23 billion.

On a GAAP basis, Facebook posted a net loss of 2 cents per share. Adjusted net income was $311 million, compared to analysts expectations of $289.7 million, according to Bloomberg.

Facebook said 14% of its ad revenue in the third quarter was from mobile, a metric that will be closely reviewed by analysts and investors as users increasingly shift to mobile.

Update: At 6:05pm EST, Facebook shares are trading up $2.35 or 12.05% to $21.85 in after-hours trading.

Facebook’s monthly active users were 1.01 billion as of Sept. 30, up 26% year over year. In its previous (second) quarter, the social network had 955 million users, up 29 percent from a year earlier.

In the closely watched mobile category, mobile MAUs were a remarkable 604 million as of Sept 30., up 61% from a year ago. In its previous quarter, mobile users grew 67 percent to 543 million.

In its previous earnings report in July, its first as a public company, the social network disappointed investors, posting earnings of 12 cents per share on $1.18 billion in revenue. Analysts expected profit of 12 cents on $1.15 billion in revenue.

In its regular trading session Tuesday, Facebook closed up $0.17 or 0.87% to $19.49.

Advertising revenue in the third quarter was $1.09 billion, up 36% from a year ago and representing 86% of total revenue. Minus foreign exchange change, the increase would have been 43%.

Investors are closely watching to see how Facebook is monetizing its users as they increasingly move to mobile devices, where Facebook has less developed revenue products. Mobile advertising generally has been seen as less profitable for Internet companies as they seek to develop new advertising and other models on much smaller screens. Facebook’s Sponsored Stories ads, which it has been moving to mobile, is a closely watched product. Facebook has also been touting its Facebook Exchange advertising product for real-time bidding.

Facebook has been busy rolling out new products in recent months, particularly focusing on revenue-generating products. In September, Facebook rolled out Facebook Gifts, which enable people to click to send a gift to a friend on their birthday. That move could mean growing ecommerce efforts by the company. Facebook also emphasized in its release on the earnings other revenue products such as Custom Audiences, Offers and mobile developer app install ads.

Share-based expenses were $1.3 billion out of a total $1.93 billion in costs in the second quarter.
