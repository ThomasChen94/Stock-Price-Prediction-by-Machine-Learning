Facebook is leaning hard on its early progress in mobile growth and monetization. “I’m […] really happy that over 600 million people now share and connect on Facebook every month using mobile devices,” Zuckerberg said in the earnings press release. “People who use our mobile products are more engaged, and we believe we can increase engagement even further as we continue to introduce new products and improve our platform. At the same time, we are deeply integrating monetization into our product teams in order to build a stronger, more valuable company.”
