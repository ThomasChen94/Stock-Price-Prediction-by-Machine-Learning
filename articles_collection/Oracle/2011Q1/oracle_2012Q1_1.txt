Oracle just released its fourth-quarter earnings results three days earlier than planned, and they’re a lot stronger than anyone expected.
The highlight is that it beat the consensus EPS by four cents, reporting earnings of 82 cents a share versus the street view of 78 cents. Revenue was in line with expectations: $10.9 billion, up 1 percent.
The other highlight is that Oracle has authorized a re-purchase of $10 billion worth of shares.
In after-hours trading, Oracle shares rose 88 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $28 a share.
The early disclosure came on chatter — which CNBC’s John Fortt just reported as confirmed moments ago — that executive vice president and head of North American Sales Keith Block has left the company. The departure comes in the wake of the surfacing of some embarrassing instant messages in a release of documents by Hewlett-Packard a few weeks ago, arising from the ongoing lawsuit between the two companies over Intel’s Itanium chip.
Oracle’s statement is below.
