Oracle's Hurd: 'We are winning' in cloud computing
The software maker has faced only limited success in its small but fast-growing cloud business. Concerns also mount over the company's core database business, which still accounts for the majority of Oracle's revenue. Oracle's licensed software business has been falling for reasons ranging from slow customer adoption to tough competition.

Total cloud revenues for the quarter were $649 million, up 26 percent, the company said. 
"We are still on target to sell and book more than $1.5 billion of new SaaS and PaaS business this fiscal year," Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison said in a statement. "That is considerably more SaaS and PaaS new business than any other cloud services provider including salesforce.com."
