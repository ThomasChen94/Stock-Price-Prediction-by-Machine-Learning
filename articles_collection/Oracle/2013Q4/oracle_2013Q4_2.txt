REDWOOD SHORES, Calif., March 18, 2014 -- Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) today
announced that fiscal 2014 Q3 total revenues were up 4% to $9.3 billion. New software licenses
and cloud software subscriptions revenues were up 4% to $2.4 billion. Software license updates
and product support revenues were up 5% to $4.6 billion. Hardware systems products revenues
were up 8% to $725 million. GAAP operating income was up 7% to $3.6 billion and the GAAP
operating margin was 38%. Non-GAAP operating income was up 5% to $4.4 billion, and the
non-GAAP operating margin was 47%. GAAP net income was up 2% to $2.6 billion, while nonGAAP
net income was unchanged at $3.1 billion. GAAP earnings per share were up 8% to
$0.56, while non-GAAP earnings per share were up 5% to $0.68. GAAP operating cash flow on
a trailing twelve-month basis was up 10% to $15 billion.
Without the impact of the US dollar strengthening compared to foreign currencies,
Oracle’s reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share would have been up 10% and non-GAAP
earnings per share would have been up 7%. In addition, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per
share both include a non-operating $0.02 per share loss this quarter as a result of exchange rate
changes in Venezuela as compared to $0.01 last year. Excluding the impact of the US dollar
strengthening compared to foreign currencies and excluding Venezuela’s exchange loss impact
on both reporting periods, Oracle’s reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share would have been
$0.59, up 12%, and non-GAAP earnings per share would have been $0.71, up 8%. GAAP and
non-GAAP total revenues also would have been up 6%. GAAP new software licenses and cloud
software subscriptions revenues would have been up 6% and non-GAAP new software licenses
and cloud software subscriptions revenues would have been up 5%. Hardware systems product
revenues would have been up 10%.
“In constant currency, our Cloud Software Subscriptions revenues grew 25% and our
Engineered Systems revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter,” said Oracle President and
CFO, Safra Catz. “Oracle Cloud Applications and Engineered Systems are both rapidly growing,
billion dollar run-rate businesses. Those two high-growth businesses helped us deliver record
year-to-date operating cash flow, and a record $15 billion of operating cash flow over the past
twelve months.”
“Sales of Oracle’s Cloud Applications accelerated sharply in the quarter with bookings
growth of over 60%,” said Oracle President Mark Hurd. “Our quarterly Cloud Application
revenue is now approaching $300 million. All of our strategic Cloud Application Suites,
including Fusion Enterprise Resource Planning, Fusion Human Capital Management and Fusion
Customer Experience, posted triple-digit revenue growth.”
“Oracle’s Engineered Server Systems, including Exadata and SPARC SuperClusters,
achieved over a 30% constant currency growth rate in the quarter, while throughout the industry
traditional high-end server product lines are in steep decline,” said Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison.
“Our Engineered Systems business is growing rapidly for the same fundamental reason that our
Cloud Applications business is growing rapidly. In both cases, customers want us to integrate the
hardware and software and make it work together, so they don’t have to.”
The Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of
outstanding common stock. This dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close
of business on April 8, 2014, with a payment date of April 29, 2014
